# KPCL-ReportGen
This repository provides the official codes of KPCL and the PED-Xray dataset.
## Dataset Details
The Pediatric Chest X-ray (PED-Xray) dataset consists of 5850 high-quality images and 2925 reports from 2,925 patients aged 1-12 years, and the X-ray images are saved in JPG format. The original data includes two views of each patient (i.e., frontal and lateral views), and a Chinese radiology report written by a clinician with more than 5 years of experience. The dataset is divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set with a ratio of 7:1:2. Notably, it is ensured that there is no overlapping of data between these sets, and basic preprocessing and manual inspection of the data are performed. The manual inspection includes deleting reports with obvious errors and anonymizing patient information to ensure the reliability of the training results and medical privacy. All data used in this dataset are collected from the imaging department database of Xiangyang Central Hospital.The dataset can also be downloaded using the following links:
